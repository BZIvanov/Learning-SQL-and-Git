## Creating custom image

Images are created based on _Dockerfile_ which holds the instructions.

Below is a simple example of how Dockerfile should look like:

```docker
# we need to specify base image, which will be used for our image, alpine in this example
FROM alpine

# below we will download and install redis, the operations is specific for alpine, it won't work with any image
RUN apk add --update redis

# below is a command which is ran, when the image starts, the same as we provide commands, when using the cli
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

With the above Dockerfile ready, we can build the image with the below command. The dot in the end is for the current directory, so we should run the command like this after we navigate the terminal to the same folder where the dockerfile is placed.

```bash
docker build .
```

After the build is ready you will get response in the console and in the end you should be able to see something like _writing image sha256:4d72a1df67e9cf56f0fe6be0af4cc41fe5270a4ec8b706fbf74e155vc2a 0.0s done_ get only the image id which is starting after sha256: and use the id to run below operation to run the image:

```
docker run 4d72a1df67e9cf56
```

And you should now have your new image and running container based on it. In this example it will be running redis console.

## Tagging Image

Instead of using _docker run some-image-id_ we can tag our image and run it by name.

We should change the build operation to something like this:

```
docker build -t biserivanov/myimg:latest .
```

- -t is to specify tagging
- before the slash is our docker id, when we create, when signing up new account
- after the slash is the name of our custom image
- after the colon is the version, common use is latest
- don't forget the dot in the end which is for the image directory

Now we can run the image with the following command:

```
docker run biserivanov/myimg
```
