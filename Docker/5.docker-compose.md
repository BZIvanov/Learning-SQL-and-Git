## Commands

- **docker compose up** - will search for the dcoker-compose.yml file and build images based on it.

- **docker compose up --build** - will search for the docker-compose.yml file to build the images, but will rebuild them in case we made some changes.

- **docker compose up -d** - will start our containers in the background so we can run additional commands. In other words the terminal will allow us to keep typing commands instead of going in the state of running server.

- **docker compose down** - will stop and remove the running containers.

- **docker compose ps** - will display info for the running containers. Note that you should run this command where the .yml file is placed, because the info is based on which container composition you want.

## Hints

If you are using restart policy and select 'no' as value, remember to put it quotes, because for the yml file _no_ is treated as false. Rest of the usable values, quotes are not required.
