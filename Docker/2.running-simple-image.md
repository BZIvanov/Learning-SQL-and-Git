## About

Here is example of running very simple image _hello-world_. It is from the docker hub and is used to test the workflow.

## Steps

1. Open a terminal and run

```
docker run hello-world
```

2. The very first time you run this image, docker will not be able to find it locally and will then search the docker hub, where is available. That is why in the terminal the first time you will see message _Unable to find image locally_. Then it will be downloaded from the docker hub and every next we will have it locally.

3. Read the text in terminal returned by the hello-world image which provides some nice basic info.
